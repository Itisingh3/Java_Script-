    <h1 style="font-size: 2.5rem;">Promise</h1>
    <p >A promise is one of these states....
        <br>
        <h2>Pending: </h2><p>Intial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.</p>
        <h2>Fulfilled: </h2><p>Meaning that the operation was completed successfully.</p>
        <h2>Rejected: </h2><p>Meaning that the operation failed.</p>
        <p>Promise generate the concept like .then() and .catch()</p>
        <p>Node.js give support to implement the promise.</p>
        <h2>Theory</h2><p>"Producing code" is code that can take some time
            <br>
            "Consuming code" is code that must wait for the result
            <br>
            Promise.then() takes two arguments, a callback for success and another for failure.
            Both are optional, so you can add a callback for success or failure only.
        </p>
        <h2>Fetch API()</h2><p>Intially XMLHttpRequest() was designed to fetch xml data via http.But , it was difficult to do. Fetch API is library which came to overcome the difficulty level....NodeJs included the fetch api in 2022...You can fetch any type of data ....
            <br>
            <code>
                <br>
                fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
                <br>
                .then((response)=>{
                    <br>
                 return response.json()
                 <br>
                })
                <br>
                .then((data)=>{
                    <br>
                console.log(data)
                <br>
                })
                <br>
                .catch((error)=>console.log(error))
                <br>
            </code>
            <br>
            The image shows fetch() in Web API.... Microtask queue priority is made to fetch the data ......
            <br>
            response = fetch('something')
            <br>
            Fetch do:
            <li>Reserved memory named data in global memory</li>
            <li>In global memory response: is generated if data request is fullfilled</li>
            <li>Resolved: Onfufilled[]</li>
            <li>Rejected: Onrejection[]</li>
            <li>Handels Web Browser API or node API: and a network request is created is resolved or rejected.</li>
        </p>
