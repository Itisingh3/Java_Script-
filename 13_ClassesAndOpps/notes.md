# JavaScript classes and Opps 
- Javascript is prototype language and its clasees are primarily syntactic sugar over existing prototype-based inheritance mechanisms. Its syntax is similar as java, c++ but under the tables it works differently....

# objects 
- collection of properties and methods.
- toLowerCase

# Why use Opps


# Parts of Opps
- Object Literals
- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instance(new,this)

# Four Pillars of Opps
- Abstraction (Hiding Details)
- Polymorphism 
- Inheritance 
- Encapsulation (Wrapper)

# new keyword
- new object will be created.
- constructor function will be called.
- this keword used to inject the value inside the      function


#  Javascript has a prototype behaviour
- Whenever you declare an array then it shows a prototypial behaviour.
- Javascipt regoriously search any behaviour to provide some methods.
- Prototype itself given the new keyword, classes.
- Protype symbol is => which is shown on a web browser
- Array declared by or is an object.
- object have no parent so it shows null.
- Array/string/function----->object----->null.
- function is also an object so whenever you serach function_name.prototype returns {} which is by defualt return by nodeJS.
